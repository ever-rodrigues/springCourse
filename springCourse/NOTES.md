Here I will be some notes about this learning project.

->Spring Bean is a simple Java Object!
    When Java objects are created by The Spring Container, then Spring refers to them as
"Spring Beans".
    Spring Beans are created from normal Java Classes ....just like Java Objects!

        JavaClass -> Beans
        JavaClass -> JavaObject

So whenever you see "Spring Beans " just think Java Object!


Inversion of Control:
->

Spring Container:
-> Primary functions:
    ->Create and manage objects ( Inversion of Control)
    ->Inject Objects dependencies ( Dependency Injection)



Configuration of Spring Container:
    ->XML configuration file (legacy)
    ->Java Annotation(modern)
    ->Java Source Code (modern)
